# YOLOv8-Based Car and Bike Accident Detection

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of **YOLOv8**  a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect car and bike accidents. Accident detection can be instrumental in initiating timely responses and improving road safety.

## Overview of YOLOv8
**YOLOv8** is the latest YOLO (You Only Look Once) series version known for real-time object detection capabilities. Improvements in YOLOv8 include:
- Enhanced architecture for better accuracy and performance.
- Improved training speed and model efficiency.
- Flexible and easier-to-use APIs.

## Project Implementation
The implementation is divided into several stages:
1. **Dataset Preparation**: The model is trained on a dataset containing images of car and bike accidents, annotated for object detection. (Roboflow is used for RAW dataset)
2. **Model Configuration**: YOLOv8's configuration is adjusted to optimize for accident detection. Pre-trained weights can be utilized to reduce training time and enhance detection accuracy.
3. **Training and Validation**: The model is trained using a suitable loss function and hyperparameters, followed by validation on a separate dataset to fine-tune its performance.
4. **Inference and Testing**: Once trained, the model performs inference on test images or real-time Photos to detect and classify accidents.

### Implementation Steps:
- **Installation and Environment Setup**: Install necessary libraries, including Ultralytics' YOLO package and other dependencies.
- **Model Training**: Utilize pre-annotated accident datasets or create custom annotations for training.
- **Model Inference**: Run the trained model on test images/videos to detect real-time accidents.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deployment**: Extend the model's application to a cloud-based service or integrate it with a mobile app.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Improve model accuracy by training on larger and more diverse datasets.
- **Real-Time Alert System**: Integrate a system for real-time accident detection and alert generation for emergency services.
